3. Use command  `heroku login` in VSCode terminal  to login in to Heroku CL
   
4. Create a file named Procfile in project root directory and insert the line `web: node server/server.js` in the file, **make sure to commit after creating the file**
   
5. In `server.js`, change `PORT || 3001` to `process.env.PORT || 3001`

   ```
   git push heroku master

   heroku ps:scale web=1

If deployment fails or any reason, make sure to try the following solutions

- Check that the Procfile is in the root directory
- Delete `package-lock.json`


## Features currently not working

- Upvoting is currently not connected to the api, therefore it is not saved and the numbers of voted will clear up after refreshing the page.

- Because the current voting system does not work, the poem will not be sorted.
